## AI Visibility Summary
_Most businesses at this early visibility stage score between 55 and 75._

**Readiness**: "Your brand is currently invisible or untrusted by AI systems. Agents will likely ignore your entity in favor of clearer competitors."

**Bottleneck**: "The primary visibility constraint is a combination of Automation Readiness and Semantic Alignment. AI systems can access your site, but inconsistent hierarchy signals and limited third-party validation reduce confidence in citing or recommending your brand."

### Fastest Score Gains
* Implement a chat widget or lead capture form to become fully equipped.
* Enrich Title Tags and Meta Descriptions to clarify semantic meaning.
* Verify business details on 3rd-party knowledge graphs (Wikidata, Crunchbase) to solidify trust.

**Closing**: "With targeted upgrades in structure and authority, your existing automation stack is well positioned to convert increased AI visibility into measurable lead flow."
