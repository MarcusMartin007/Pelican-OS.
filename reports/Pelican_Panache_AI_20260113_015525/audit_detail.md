## AI Visibility Summary
_Most businesses at this early visibility stage score between 55 and 75._

**Readiness**: "AI systems can find and understand your brand, but may hesitate to cite or recommend it due to authority and alignment gaps."

**Bottleneck**: "The primary visibility constraint is a combination of Semantic Alignment and Authority & Reinforcement. AI systems can access your site, but inconsistent hierarchy signals and limited third-party validation reduce confidence in citing or recommending your brand."

### Fastest Score Gains
* Enrich Title Tags and Meta Descriptions to clarify semantic meaning.
* Generate 3-5 new reviews on Google/Trustpilot to validate authority.
* Monitor and optimize existing conversion interactions to ensure AI-driven traffic is captured efficiently.

**Closing**: "With targeted upgrades in structure and authority, your existing automation stack is well positioned to convert increased AI visibility into measurable lead flow."
