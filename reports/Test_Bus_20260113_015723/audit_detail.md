## AI Visibility Summary

**Readiness**: "Your brand is currently invisible or untrusted by AI systems. Agents will likely ignore your entity in favor of clearer competitors."

**Bottleneck**: "The primary visibility constraint is a combination of Entity Clarity and Authority & Reinforcement. AI systems can access your site, but inconsistent hierarchy signals and limited third-party validation reduce confidence in citing or recommending your brand."

### Fastest Score Gains
* Claim your Google Business Profile to lock in identity trust.
* Generate 3-5 new reviews on Google/Trustpilot to validate authority.
* Install a conversion interactions (Chat/Forms) to capture AI-driven traffic.

**Closing**: "With targeted upgrades in structure and authority, your existing automation stack is well positioned to convert increased AI visibility into measurable lead flow."
